# [WTF is it?](#)

***watchCrypto*** is a simple watchlist chrome extension that allows you to quickly and easily add/remove cryptocurrencies to keep track of their price and percentage of daily gains or losses using the CoinMarketCap API...
You will need an API Key, which is **free** from [CoinMarketCap](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/signup/)

You can snoop through all the code here on github without having to install any special software, but I would highly suggest using a code editor with dark mode so you don't burn your eyes. Any app below is more than adequate and there are dozens more out there, so pick whichever fancy text editor makes you feel cool.

# [Install](#)

If you haven't already, download the zip and unzip it to its own folder. Let's say, for example, you have watchCrypto-master.zip on your Desktop. You'll want to unzip it so it leaves a watchCrypto folder on your Desktop... *`(you can put the folder anywhere you like)`*

Open Chrome Extensions (**`chrome://extensions/`**) and turn developer mode on

* [**Load unpacked**](#) and select [***watchCrypto***](#) folder
  >The extension will install itself with a red tag signifying that it's an unpacked extension. You might get an annoying warning every time you launch Chrome when using unpacked extensions. This is normal...

If you didn't mess that up, you should now be able to go play with your new toy. Configuring the app should be self explanatory once you get in there. If you need help beyond that...
